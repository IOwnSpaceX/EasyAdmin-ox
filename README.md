# üî® EASYADMIN USING OX_LIB MENU üî®

# NEW UPDATE! v1.4.0
I have integrated https://github.com/ItsAmmarB/DeathScript to EasyAdmin so you must be on duty to adrev/adres players. I will list the aces below! üíñ
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adrev`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adres`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adrevall`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adresall`

I have also integrated the jail script into EasyAdmin so no need for the jail resource from UPDATE v1.2.0 as its already integrated into the EasyAdmin file now!

# NEW UPDATE! v1.3.0
I have added noclip to EasyAdmin and added a clockin/out script that is already integrated into the resource. **YOU MUST BE CLOCKED IN TO USE NOCLIP**
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.noclip allow`

# NEW UPDATE! v1.2.0
I have added EasyAdmin Jail using my jail script: https://github.com/IOwnSpaceX/Liam-Jail and added some new notifications.

The ace perms to use the new jail/unjail functions are:
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.jail allow`

`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.unjail allow`

This resource is just **__EasyAdmin__** by: https://github.com/Blumlaut **(I AM __NOT__ THE ORIGINAL CREATOR)**

I created this resource to give a better UI look to EasyAdmin. Now when you use the menu the ox_lib menu will show up and you can input your options through the menu. Ox_lib by: https://github.com/overextended has helped me to improve this menu.

I have also integrated a toggle cuff system that by default uses the **Sem Interaction Menu** by: https://github.com/Sc0ttM to handle cuffing events. You may add your own event to trigger cuffing by using `TriggerEvent('CuffingSystem:Cuff', Player.id)` as an example.

I will try to my best to keep up with EasyAdmin's update frequency so everything custom I put into the menu should remain in working condition.

‚≠ê Starring my repos are always helpful and meaningful to me so thank you to anybody who stars my repo.
