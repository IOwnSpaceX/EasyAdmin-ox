# SMALL UPDATE
I have added a refresh action history button. I have also updated the jail UI so it now displays time 24/7 and shows the reason for why you might have been jailed.

# NEW UPDATE v1.6.0
I have added a cooldown of 5 minutes after you clock out unless you have the bypass ace ```add_ace group.NAME atlasduty.bypass``` and the cooldown is waived. Punishment History is finally here thanks to https://github.com/DukeOfCheese and his storage script. You can use the aces listed in order to view punishment history:
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.actionhistory.view`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.actionhistory.add`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.actionhistory.delete`

# NEW UPDATE v1.5.0
I have integrated the liam-jail feature into the menu so you **NO** longer need the resource (https://github.com/IOwnSpaceX/liam-jail) and can remove it since it is now apart of the EasyAdmin-ox resource.
I have now added checks to close the menu and remove the player from noclip if they use /clockout while in noclip or have the menu open it will now close. I have also added some emoji's and colors to the menu when you click on the player if you do not like this feature go into the ```en.json``` file and revert the menu back to your own personal preference. A notification now shows up when you are not clocked in and try to open the menu that tells you to clock in to use. I have removed the slider on the ox_lib input box for the banning function because people were having difficulties with the slider so it is now a number box.

I have also removed the package file that causes issues with the menu and your server will install it automatically when you start it. It is recommended to restart server on a fresh install of EasyAdmin.

I already have ideas for update v1.6.0 including punishment history stored into the menu via a json file. I may also add dragging toggle functionality into the misc options. Thanks for using my forked resource!

# UPDATES WILL NO LONGER BE CONTINUED SO STOP DMing ME!!!
I appreciate all the support that this resource has gotten since I published it a few months ago, but I have left my dream of coding to pursue other things in life and have left FiveM, Discord, and all that drama behind me and have moved on. With that being said the resource will stay how it is and will no longer be updated. If you would like updates you can check the forks of this resource (DO NOT TRUST EVERY FORK) as some may lead to issues and are not approved by me in any way. Thank you for choosing my resource. üôè

Thanks, Liam (IOwnSpaceX)

# üî® EASYADMIN USING OX_LIB MENU üî®

# NEW UPDATE! v1.4.0
I have integrated https://github.com/ItsAmmarB/DeathScript to EasyAdmin so you must be on duty to adrev/adres players. I will list the aces below! üíñ
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adrev`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adres`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adrevall`
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.adresall`

I have also integrated the jail script into EasyAdmin so no need for the jail resource from UPDATE v1.2.0 as its already integrated into the EasyAdmin file now!

# NEW UPDATE! v1.3.0
I have added noclip to EasyAdmin and added a clockin/out script that is already integrated into the resource. **YOU MUST BE CLOCKED IN TO USE NOCLIP**
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.noclip allow`

# NEW UPDATE! v1.2.0
I have added EasyAdmin Jail using my jail script: https://github.com/IOwnSpaceX/Liam-Jail and added some new notifications.

The ace perms to use the new jail/unjail functions are:
`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.jail allow`

`add_ace group.NAME easyadmin.player.unjail allow`

This resource is just **__EasyAdmin__** by: https://github.com/Blumlaut **(I AM __NOT__ THE ORIGINAL CREATOR)**

I created this resource to give a better UI look to EasyAdmin. Now when you use the menu the ox_lib menu will show up and you can input your options through the menu. Ox_lib by: https://github.com/overextended has helped me to improve this menu.

I have also integrated a toggle cuff system that by default uses the **Sem Interaction Menu** by: https://github.com/Sc0ttM to handle cuffing events. You may add your own event to trigger cuffing by using `TriggerEvent('CuffingSystem:Cuff', Player.id)` as an example.

I will try to my best to keep up with EasyAdmin's update frequency so everything custom I put into the menu should remain in working condition.

‚≠ê Starring my repos are always helpful and meaningful to me so thank you to anybody who stars my repo.

**MAIN RESOURCE**
Easyadmin you can find the github link to Easyadmin here: https://github.com/Blumlaut/EasyAdmin


üíª **Installation**

This is a drag and drop resource. Open your `server.cfg` file, ensure/start EasyAdmin, then drag and drop the resource and it should set itself up.
