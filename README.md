# üî® EASYADMIN USING OX_LIB MENU üî®

This resource is just **__EasyAdmin__** by: https://github.com/Blumlaut **(I AM __NOT__ THE ORIGINAL CREATOR)**

I created this resource to give a better UI look to EasyAdmin. Now when you use the menu the ox_lib menu will show up and you can input your options through the menu. Ox_lib by: https://github.com/overextended has helped me to improve this menu.

I have also integrated a toggle cuff system that by default uses the **Sem Interaction Menu** by: https://github.com/Sc0ttM to handle cuffing events. You may add your own event to trigger cuffing by using `TriggerEvent('CuffingSystem:Cuff', Player.id)` as an example.

I will try to my best to keep up with EasyAdmin's update frequency so everything custom I put into the menu should remain in working condition.
