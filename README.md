# About EasyAdmin-ox
Hello, and welcome to EasyAdmin-ox an idea to bring more customizability/tweaks to the already great EasyAdmin menu created by [Blumlaut](https://github.com/Blumlaut). This specific menu takes advantage of the [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) library and functions. Thank you so much to [Easyadmin](https://github.com/Blumlaut/EasyAdmin) for the incredible base menu. For documentation and ace perms [click me!](https://easyadmin.readthedocs.io/en/7.51) If you find any issues please feel free to make an [issues request](https://github.com/IOwnSpaceX/EasyAdmin-ox/issues) or if you know how to solve the issue create a [pull request](https://github.com/IOwnSpaceX/EasyAdmin-ox/pulls) and I will lookover your changes.
