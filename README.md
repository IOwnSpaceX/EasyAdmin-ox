# About EasyAdmin-ox
Hello, and welcome to EasyAdmin-ox an idea to bring more customizability/tweaks to the already great EasyAdmin menu created by [Blumlaut](https://github.com/Blumlaut). This specific menu takes advantage of the [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) library and functions. Thank you so much to [Easyadmin](https://github.com/Blumlaut/EasyAdmin) for the incredible base menu.
